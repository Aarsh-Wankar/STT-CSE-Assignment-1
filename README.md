## Lab 4
The three repositories first need to be cloned using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cli/cli.git
git clone https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core.git
git clone https://github.com/cucumber/messages.git
```

The csv files containing the analysis results were not included in the repositories and need to be generated by running the code in the respective notebooks.
